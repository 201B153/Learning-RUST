Rust-Lesson
- In Rust the no. overShadows the Previos variable but not replace it like in example Shadowing.rs
- OwnerShip is only present in rust it is set of rules that manages garbage memory in .rs files
- Ownership Rules::
Each value in Rust has an owner.
There can only be one owner at a time.
When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
- That first part is done by us: when we call String::from, its implementation requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming languages.
